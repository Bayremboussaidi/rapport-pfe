\chapter{Needs Analysis and Specification}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter formally defines and analyzes the functional and non-functional needs of the car rental platform. By identifying limitations in existing systems, this section translates user expectations into specific system requirements, focusing on secure, real-time, and scalable services for car rentals, including role-based interactions, authentication, booking workflows, communication, and deployment. Following the context and problem analysis outlined in Chapter 1, this chapter ensures that the platform meets real user needs efficiently and securely.

The requirements analysis follows a systematic approach:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Actor Identification}: Defining who interacts with the system and their responsibilities.
    \item \textbf{Functional Requirements}: Specifying what the system must do for each actor.
    \item \textbf{Non-Functional Requirements}: Defining quality attributes like performance, security, and scalability.
    \item \textbf{Use Case Modeling}: Visualizing interactions between actors and the system.
    \item \textbf{Class Modeling}: Defining the data structures and relationships.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Actors Identification}
An actor represents an external entity that interacts with the system. Actors can be humans (users with different roles) or systems (automated services). Understanding actors is crucial for defining system boundaries and requirements.

The MyLoc platform supports the following primary actors:

\section{Project Management Methodology}

\subsection{Traditional vs Agile Methods}
Before selecting a methodology for this project, it is essential to understand the fundamental differences between traditional (classical) and agile approaches to project management. The following table presents a comprehensive comparison:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\small
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.8cm}|p{5.2cm}|p{5.2cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!20}
\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Traditional Methods} & \textbf{Agile Methods} \\
\hline
Process & Linear, sequential (V-Model, Waterfall) & Iterative, incremental (Scrum, Kanban) \\
\hline
Requirements & Detailed specs fixed at project start & Evolving specs, adjusted continuously \\
\hline
Flexibility & Low, hard to integrate changes & High, continuous adaptation \\
\hline
Delivery & Single delivery at project end & Frequent functional increments \\
\hline
Client Interaction & Limited after requirements phase & Continuous collaboration \\
\hline
Risk Management & Upfront identification, few adjustments & Continuous with iterative adjustments \\
\hline
Planning & Complete upfront, rigid & Flexible, adjusted per iteration \\
\hline
Ideal Project & Simple, well-defined, stable & Complex, evolving requirements \\
\hline
Examples & V-Model, Waterfall, PERT & Scrum, Kanban, XP \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison between Traditional and Agile Methods}
\label{tab:traditional_vs_agile}
\end{table}

\subsection{Methodology Selection}
The choice of the Scrum methodology for our project is based on several fundamental considerations. Before detailing the advantages of Scrum, it is relevant to compare this methodology with other recognized agile approaches, such as \textbf{Kanban} and \textbf{Extreme Programming (XP)}.

The following comparative table presents the three agile methods and justifies the choice of Scrum:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\small
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.2cm}|p{3.6cm}|p{3.6cm}|p{3.6cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!20}
\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Scrum} & \textbf{Kanban} & \textbf{XP} \\
\hline
Structure & Fixed sprints (10-15 days), defined roles \& ceremonies & Visual board, no fixed iterations & Short iterations, rigorous practices \\
\hline
Flexibility & Adaptation at sprint end & Real-time priority changes & Flexible but requires rigor \\
\hline
Collaboration & Strong via ceremonies \& retrospectives & Continuous but less structured & Intense (pair programming) \\
\hline
Tracking & Burndown charts, Daily Scrum & Kanban board & Frequent feedback \\
\hline
Ideal For & Frequent deliveries & Continuous flow projects & High-quality software \\
\hline
Adaptability & High at sprint boundaries & Continuous & Feedback-driven \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison between Agile Methods: Scrum, Kanban, and XP}
\label{tab:agile_comparison}
\end{table}

\textbf{Justification for Choosing Scrum:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scrum} is chosen for its clear structure, which combines flexibility and rigor, while promoting close collaboration and continuous adaptation at each sprint.
    \item This methodology is particularly suited to our project, which requires regular deliveries and strong interaction with stakeholders.
    \item \textbf{Kanban} is flexible but lacks structure for projects requiring well-defined iterations.
    \item \textbf{XP} is very effective for code quality but demands rigorous discipline and is more oriented towards pure software development.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scrum Methodology Overview}
Scrum is an agile project management method designed to improve team productivity, even remotely, while allowing continuous product optimization through regular user feedback. Inspired by rugby, where teams gather in a scrum, Scrum encourages a dynamic and participative approach to project management.

This ensures a fair balance between initial investment and the final delivered product, offering flexibility to redirect the project along the way. Scrum is widely adopted by development teams because it promotes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collaboration with the client
    \item Acceptance of change
    \item Interaction between team members
    \item Delivery of operational software
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/scrum.PNG}
    \caption{Scrum Methodology Overview}
    \label{fig:scrum_methodology}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scrum Key Concepts}

\textbf{Sprint}\\
Scrum breaks down the project into different iterations called sprints. Each sprint lasts no more than four weeks, during which the team develops the features specified in the product backlog.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)}\\
This is a 15-minute daily meeting that tracks project progress. During this meeting, team members present:

\subsection{Chapter Conclusion}
In this chapter, we explored the functional and non-functional requirements for the car rental platform. We identified the different user roles (Admin, Agency, Customer, Visitor), their needs, and outlined the system features accordingly. 

We also established the development methodology using Scrum, assigned team roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), and laid out the complete sprint plan with a detailed product backlog containing 40 user stories totaling 210 story points. The project was organized into 8 sprints with an average team velocity of 26.25 story points per sprint.

This structured specification ensures the platform is developed efficiently, securely, and in alignment with user needs through iterative development and continuous feedback.

\section{Conclusion}
The analysis and specification phase has established a solid foundation for the project. With clearly defined requirements, comprehensive use case diagrams, and a detailed Scrum planning with product backlog, the development team is well-prepared to begin implementation.

In the following chapters, we will detail the realization of each sprint, starting with Sprint 1 focused on platform setup and secure authentication using Keycloak.
