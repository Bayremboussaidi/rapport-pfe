This project aimed to design, develop, and deploy a comprehensive car rental web platform, tailored to the needs of different users: administrators, agencies, customers, and visitors. Following an Agile Scrum methodology and leveraging modern DevOps tools, we successfully completed all phases, from requirements analysis to deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

The platform successfully integrates several key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure multi-role authentication and access control via Keycloak.
    \item Vehicle management by administrators and agencies, including photo management.
    \item Smooth booking process with real-time availability checking and agency validation.
    \item Automatic email notifications and PDF contract generation with integrated QR code.
    \item Real-time chat system facilitating communication between agencies and administrators.
    \item Intelligent chatbot offering 24/7 support via Flask and OpenAI integration.
    \item Intelligent car filtering service with MyLoc agency priority display.
    \item Robust CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, Docker containerization, and scalable Kubernetes deployment.
\end{itemize}

This project successfully combines RESTful architecture, microservices modularity, and artificial intelligence tools to deliver a complete, scalable, and maintainable solution.
